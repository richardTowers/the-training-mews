For anyone wishing to train with their trainer at the Training Mews there’s a £85 monthly fee which includes access to an exclusive and private training studio which includes provision of shower facilities, towels, water, tea and coffee. 

Initial payment can be made by bank transfer, then continued as a direct debt. Shorter term training fees from 1 to 3 months are also available and can be quoted upon request at sales@thetrainingmews.co.uk.

Once this fee has been paid, all members can purchase our full range of services using [our online booking system](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/explore/locations/the-training-mews). These include open gym slots ranging from £5-10 per hour and one-to-one personal training sessions ranging from £80-140 per hour.
