## About us

Welcome to The Training Mews, a personal training studio located in the heart of Kensington, London.

We pride ourselves on offering exceptional personal training with high quality gym equipment to a select group of clients.

The founding trainers, Paul Bowman and Lawrence Xavier Davis are friendly, qualified and experienced professionals, dedicated to helping you achieve your fitness goals.

We created this space to meet the growing demand for a space where personal trainers can train their clients privately. We also allow exceptional trainers to rent the studio to train their clients.

We will work with you to create a personalised training plan that is tailored to your needs and fitness. Whether you're looking to lose weight, build muscle, recover from injury or simply improve your overall fitness, our trainers will provide you with the guidance and support you need to succeed.
